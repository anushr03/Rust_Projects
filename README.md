This Repo keeps track of all the projects I did to learn the Rust language using the Rust official programming language pdf([book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html))

# 1. Hello_world and Hello_cargo

Intial hello wrold code to introduce myself to the Rust Programming language

# 2. guessing_game

A user input guessing game, run via the terminal, where the user keeps on guessing the number until it matches the random number seelcted by the code. I added another functionality to this where the user can input q and exit the game at any given time.

# 3. variables

An introduction to variables in Rust. Learned about <ins>shadowing</ins>, <ins>floating points</ins> and difference between <ins>tuples and arrays</ins> in Rust

# 4. Functions

Learned about functions. 

#### a. Statements and Expressions
Firstly learned about the difference between statements and expression. Statements do not return a value and expressions return a value. This is why expressions do not have a semicolon. If we add the semicolon, it becomes a statement and therefore will not return a value.

#### b. Functions with return values
Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We donâ€™t name return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow (->)
